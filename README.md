# Test Repository

This is a small test repository containing a simple bash script that displays ASCII art.

## Contents

- `.gitignore`: Standard gitignore file for common patterns
- `ascii_art.sh`: Bash script that displays ASCII art
- `README.md`: This file
- `LICENSE`: WTFPL license file

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/test-repository.git
   cd test-repository
   ```

2. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ascii_art.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./ascii_art.sh
   ```

## ASCII Art Preview

When executed, the script will display a colorful "Test Repository" ASCII art banner in your terminal.

## Customization
